FACTORY METHOD
--------------
Also known as: Virtual Constructor

Intent
------
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Applicability
-------------

# Use the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
# The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code.
